# picoTemp
## An LED Temperature Indicator Using the Raspberry Pi Pico
To Start, Please Connect a Green LED Diode to GPIO Pin 0 & Corresponding Ground & Connect a Red LED Diode to GPIO Pin 15 and Ground. Afterwards, connect a USB Power Source (e.g. Battery Pack), to see it work!

When the **Green** Led Turns On, that means the temperature is **below** the threshold temperature, Red Otherwise.
## Things to Work On / Improve
1. Design of the Chassis should be More Portable & Sustainable
2. Thersehold should be adjusted manually by the user (e.g. adding a potentiometer)

This is A Good Starting Project for Learning the Raspberry Pi Pico!

Note: There is a Hard Coded Temperature Threshold of 100Â° F
